Garreth Carroll - Artist.

My first Milestone Project 

Throughout this project I will be using everything that I have learnt so far from Code Institue. This project will consist of HTML5, CSS3 bootstrap framwork & fancybox plugins.

My site is for the purpose of my friend Garreth Carroll who is an aspiring artist and teacher. I have decided not to go with the proposed band website as outlined on the brief but instead take what I've learned to date on this course and implement it in order to present a fully functional fron-end website. One my friend can proudly present his artwork on.

This website is designed to benefit Garreth Carroll and showcase his work. It is also a base to link together his different social media accounts. PLEASE NOTE: As of completing this site, Garreth Carroll has only created 2 social media accoutns. I've included multiple channels on the site of which will be updated at a later date to inculed his youtube,pinterest, twitter and linklden accounts.

My goal as a web developer for this site was to create a full functionally front end website that was simply laid out, that didn't take away from the art pieces, that showcased what I have learned to date and one I can continue to update after this module. My goal taking on a webiste for a "client" was to work closely with Garreth on everything from layout to font style to coloring. I involved him in every aspect of the design making sure he was happy with the final desgin.

UX The UX for this project is very simple. A mainly a static site for Garreths followers and possible new followers to appreciate his artistic work. A site for his followers from all social networking groups to come together to appreciate his work and contact him for any project work or request. It was also designed in mind for instagram followers to connect to his facebook followers and vise versa. Additional requirments from the site was to showcase either an artist of the week or technique of the week either done from himself or from a fellow artist. The color scheme and font design was choosen to make sure the site was not taking away from the art work. I did include free background images (sourced from www.pexels.com) behind certain elements of the pages as this was at the request of the client. I included some animation on both mobile devices and above to bring a certain flow to the page but while still not taking away from the artwork.

I used fancybox javascript plugin to bring a more astehically pleasing design and animation to the images when viewing them.

Features All the images for this project have been provided by Garreth Carrol, he creates all his own artwork. All background imagery was sourced from www.pexels.com. All free stock photos. - Background images were altered to improve loading of the page.

Fancybox - Javascript plugin used for a more astehically pleasing design and animation. Very fluid

Social buttons - I have added the Garreths social links on the footer of each page. PLEASE NOTE: To date as of completing the site Garreth as only 2 social media accoutns. Facebook and Instagram. I have included other social media icons but they will not work as I have not been provided the social media links for linklden , twitter, youtube & pinterest. THIS IS NOT A FAULT WITH THE SITE. I have purposely included these social media icons even though they do not link to his social media accounts bar facebook and instagram. This links are included in hopes of linking his facebook followers with his instagram followers and vice versa.

Gallery - Images were optimized to reduce size to improve page laod speed. Fancy box plugin used to bring a more fluid state to his images and bring more animation to the website. Fancy box was an implemented to improve the UX for the gallery when viewed by a visitor.

Contact form (footer & contact page) - Basic layout taken from previous modules studied. I have included validation on all elements of the form element. - In the future I would like to updated the back end capabilities for all forms on this site.

Wireframing was done prior to talking to Garreth. Upon the first initial design of the landing page, I changed it twice before commiting to the current design. Main changes were font style and coloring. This was decided after creating a futher 3 more wireframe designs.

Possible feature to implement

Subscription form could be added to site. - Mailing list could be created with emails sent out when a new image as beed included.

Possible place to purchase images. - Will need to figure out how to create this both from a front end aspect and a back end aspect.

Instagram photos pull from his instagram account.

Facebook ecents puull from his facebook account.

Pull in the latest imagery comments from Instagram and Facebook.

Add a descriptive piece to each art work image when clicked on. I would like this to only show within the fancybox layout beside each image.
